      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>Hi, I'm Jeff. Or Jeffrey (Jeff-rey). But not Jeffery (Jeff-er-y), and definitely not Geoffrey (Jaw-free). Other Jeffreys know the struggle. Maybe it would be easier if you just called me Jeff... </p>

      <p>Born and raised in Southern California, and recent grad from school in Northern California. I completed my education at UC Berkeley with a degree in EECS (Electrical Engineering &amp; Computer Science), with more emphasis in Computer Science. I'm really interested in software engineering, and in general love the field of computer science and its community.</p>

      <p>As a gamer, I've taken what I've learned to create games of my own. You can find some of these games in the <%= link_to "For Fun", fun_path %> tab of the site. Also, check out the mobile game <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bookin-it/id1057026778?mt=8" target="_blank">Bookin' It</a> on the App Store, created entirely by a couple of my friends and myself. I really enjoy games that are challenging and difficult, so frustration, addiction, and great satisfaction upon accomplishment are common feelings while playing. In a way, don't these feelings sum up the life of a coder pretty well?</p>

      <p>I like to think I'm a grateful person, and I'm especially grateful for the Computer Science community. I enjoyed my time giving back as a lab assistant, grader, and teaching assistant for five semesters plus a summer session at Berkeley. I taught students, contributed to the development of the course, and worked with my professor to spread the course across the nation. Check out the <a href="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Beauty and Joy of Computing</a> and <a href="http://cs10.org/" target="_blank">Computer Science 10</a>!</p>

      <p>My hobbies include all sorts of games. Video games, board games, gambling. And yes, gambling is a losing game (statistically speaking), but as long as you're responsible, you're really just paying for entertainment right? I also enjoy golfing, running, playing guitar, and cooking. Additionally I'm a Boy Scout Eagle Scout, so I do my best to apply the Scout motto "Be Prepared" in all aspects of life.</p>
